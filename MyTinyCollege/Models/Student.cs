       Within the Entity Framework, the Enrollments property is called a
       navigation property.  Navigation properties hold other entities that are
       related to this entity.  In this case, the enrollments property of a student
       entity will hold all of the enrollment entities that are related to that
       student entity.
       
       In other words, if a given student row in a database has two related enrollment
       rows (PK-FK) that student entity's enrollment navigation property will contain
       those two enrollment entities.
